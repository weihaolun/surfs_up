# Surf's Up with SQLite
## I. Overview of Project

### Background

I have been planning to open Surfing Shake Shop in Hawaii, serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists. My investor, W. Avy, is very supportive to the plan, but he has one concern: the weather. Weather is going to be a serious factor because it directly affects the surfing business. For this project, I have run some analytics on a weather dataset of the island to determine the weather trend and the business potential.

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to:

1.	Determine the summary statistics for June temperature.
2.	Determine the summary statistics for September temperature.
3.	Analysis the key differences in weather between June and December.
4.	Write two additional queries to gather more weather data for June and December.

## II. Results
